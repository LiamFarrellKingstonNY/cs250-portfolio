## Essential Questions — Reflection

### 1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How do user stories help?
I start by translating stakeholder goals into **user stories** that capture who needs what and why (e.g., “As a traveler, I want to search destinations so that I can plan an itinerary”). Each story has **acceptance criteria** that define done ness and testability. That structure lets me size and prioritize work, aligning directly to business value. During the SNHU Travel project, we maintained a prioritized backlog, refined stories before sprints, and validated acceptance criteria at the Sprint Review keeping implementation tightly mapped to user outcomes. 

### 2) How do I approach developing programs? Which Agile processes will I use going forward?
I work iteratively in short **sprints** with a clear Sprint Goal and a small, testable slice of functionality. I plan with **story points**, meet daily to surface blockers, and maintain flow on a visible **Kanban/boards** tool. Each increment meets a shared **Definition of Done** (coded, tested, and reviewed). I’ll continue using:
- **Sprint Planning** for realistic commitments,
- **Daily Scrums** for transparency and quick adaptation,
- **Sprint Reviews** to gather stakeholder feedback early and often,
- **Sprint Retrospectives** for continuous improvement,
- Lightweight artifacts like **burndown** and a visible **Product Backlog**.
This approach let us reprioritize when requirements shifted (e.g., currency-conversion integration) without derailing progress, demonstrating agility over rigidity. 

### 3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good teammate is **accountable, communicative, and cross-functional**. They share progress and impediments openly, swarm on high-value work, and uphold quality through code reviews and clear acceptance criteria. They also respect timeboxes, keep work visible, and contribute to a psychologically safe environment where issues are raised early. In our project, consistent updates and ceremony discipline fostered shared ownership and reliable delivery each sprint.

### Notes
- The artifact reflects Scrum roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team), ceremonies, and incremental delivery from the SNHU Travel project, with comparisons to Waterfall when relevant.
